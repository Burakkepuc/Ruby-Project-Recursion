# Ruby Recursion

This Recursion project is part of [The Odin Project]("https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby/lessons/recursion"). Contains 3 project, Both of them is recursion project. These are fibonacci and merge sort. Another is warm up fibonacci project without recursion.

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.

## Merge Sort

1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
2. Tips:
   - Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).
   - It may be helpful to check out the background videos agaein if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.
